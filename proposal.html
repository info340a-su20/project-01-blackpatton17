                Faced with the problem of not remembering what food is in the refrigerator, many people do not have a
                fixed solution. Almost everyone is on a budget these days and saving money at the grocery store is
                one of the best ways to cut down on spending. With all of the time, money, and effort spent shopping
                for perishable food items, ensuring that they don't go to waste is important. In other words, an
                application that can record the time and expiration date of the last food purchase is very important.

                And most of the existing applications only support a single operating system platform, which means
                that if family members or co-renting partners use different operating systems, they will encounter the
                inconvenience of being unable to share refrigerator information. What's more, these applications do
                not reflect the convenience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT</a>
                technology, because they often require users to manually enter all data instead of importing data
                through barcodes or reports file from stores' website.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                In response to the research on the above issues, this project will build a cloud application to record and
                manage refrigerator food storage. The user will enter the information of each purchase through a mobile
                device or desktop computer and store it in the
                <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Firebase Realtime Database</a>.
                The user can enter the record of each food purchase through the following methods:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>barcode scanning</li>
                <li>manual input</li>
                <li>importing data from external report file (e.g. csv, JSON file)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Through multiple data input sources, the application can greatly simplify the user's operation
                process. Users do not need to record all purchase records through tedious manual entry. Barcodes and
                external report files (e.g.
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/b2b/reports" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Amazon order history</a>
                ) will be used as a means to record main information, such as product name and quantity and price, while
                manual input will be used as an auxiliary means to complete other information, such as "best by" dates.

                This application will be suitable for all users who do not have enough time and energy to manage the
                refrigerator. On the basis of user data, which is the record of food in the refrigerator, the
                application will generate a list of recommended purchase items so that the user can draw up plans for
                the next purchase. And since this application is a web application, it can perform the task of running
                across platforms very well. This can solve the aforementioned problem that information cannot be shared
                between devices us`ing different operating systems.
